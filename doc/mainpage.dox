/** @mainpage qLibs
* A collection of useful libraries written in C for embedded systems. qLibs 
* is developed using a formal and rigorous process framed in compliance with 
* the MISRA C 2012 and CERT coding standard guidelines and complemented with 
* multiple static-analysis checks targeted to safe critical applications.
*
* qLibs includes the following modules:
*
